# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but there are some guidelines that will make everything easier.

* For simplicity's sake, please open an issue first even if you intend to submit code. You can reference the issue from the pull request.
* Opening an issue begins a conversation. Many of the particulars can be worked out before a PR is even submitted.

 * **Be clear** about what problem is occurring and how someone can recreate that problem or why your feature will help.
 * **Itâ€™s best to test.** Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed.
 * **Contribute in the style of the project** to the best of your abilities.
 * **How does this change help others?** Most likely the answer to this question is the same way the change helped you.
 * **Why would the project maintain this code for you?** What benefit does the project get from your contribution?

## When Submitting

* Be sure to submit pull requests against the appropriate branch. **Do not submit requests against `master`. They will be rejected.**
* Follow good practices for Git commit messages (See http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ for tips on writing good commit messages.)
    * Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
    * Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
    * Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
    * Make sure that commits have descriptive text that clearly explains the change
* Reference appropriate issues or pull requests if needed. (Use `refs XXX` instead of `fixes XXX` or `closes XXX`)
